# Minesweeper-Project
This repository contains a project in where, given sprites, assets, and access to the SFML library, I recreated a functional game of Minesweeper.
Game appears when compiler is run, can be played as any game of Minesweeper is. 
The differing icons on the board perform notable functions - the face icon shows whether you have lost the game or not, the flag icon allows you to put markers to help you note where bombs are, different test boards with set layouts are available on the right, and there is also a counter showing how many bombs remain given the number of flags placed.
